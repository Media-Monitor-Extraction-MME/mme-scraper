I watched Cast Away, Hundreds of Beavers, and Divines.\n\nCast Away is about a FedEx analyst who gets stranded on a deserted Island, his survival, and his attempt to get back to civilization.\n\nEven though FedEx is featured in the synopsis and all that, I figured it was gonna be some cheap product placement, but it influences the themes and plot, and if anything, it makes the company look bad. Apple won\u2019t allow villains to use their phones nowadays because that obviously means Apple = evil, but FedEx is like fuck it, our employees are assholes and some of our planes might explode. It makes the company feel more self-aware and real as opposed to Apple who feel like a cheap front for a super villain because they can\u2019t look part their own nose and realize forcing a positive image mostly has the opposite effect.\n\nThe first act is really good, as it gives Tom Hanks some strong characterization, making him obsessed with his job and time in general. He has the typical \u201cforgoing Christmas with the fianc\u00e9 in favor of the job\u201d attitude, but the time they spend on screen together also show him being genuinely loving and not just brushing her off. It\u2019s still very archetypical, but they get the most out of this short time and there\u2019s some nuance there. Nuance that\u2019s essential for the driving force of the movie to be believable.\n\nAfter the first act ends with an action scene that almost goes too hard, the second act takes its time by not doing a whole lot of anything besides survival. It\u2019s very slow but FedEx comes to the rescue in form of packages being washed ashore. I would have opened them much sooner but besides that, it\u2019s peak \u201cwhat would you do in this scenario\u201d cinema, which basically ensures engagement all the time. It might be slow, but it\u2019s still paced very well, tricklingly introducing new elements that move things forward. I really liked how the packages come into play, containing stuff that\u2019s seemingly useless on first glance but can be reappropriated, which is also where the \u201cwhat would you do in this scenario\u201d aspect is at its strongest.\n\nWilson also comes at the perfect time to switch things up and keep the dialogue at an organic level. It gives Hanks something to play off of and this adds a much-needed layer that keeps things from becoming dull.\n\nThe time jump came as a bit of a shock, but it quickly proves to have been a great decision in how it catches you up on things that happened. It keeps the pace up, which is much needed because it really stretches itself as much as possible with the island part and it would have more than overstayed its welcome without the jump.\n\nThe part where he leaves made me realize that while I liked the island part, I wasn\u2019t too emotionally invested. How he looks back at his home of the last 4 years with ambivalence while it disappears into the fog would have left me pretty cold if it wasn\u2019t for the music. Same with Wilson floating away. He never felt like an actual character as much as a supplement for Tom Hanks.\n\nThe last act is incredible, meaning I prefer the parts that aren\u2019t about survival in this survival movie. Though saying the last act isn\u2019t about survival is disingenuous. It\u2019s arguably more about survival than the island part because the actual survival of the body isn\u2019t much compared to the survival of the soul if you\u2019re the one who can influence things. The ice skates or VHS-tapes might have tangibly contributed to the survival of his body, but the package he left unopened contributed to the survival of his soul. The picture of his fianc\u00e9 kept him going on the island, but learning she had to move on threatens to destroy him even though, or maybe especially because, he\u2019s in familiar territory. Time waits for no one even if for him it essentially stood still for 4 years. A concept he\u2019s all too familiar with.\n\nThe nuance of the first act is also present here, giving the cliched Hollywood moment a bittersweet tinge that makes it earn its emotions and isn\u2019t just a corny spectacle in place of emotions.\n\nAnd because all these elements go together beautifully, the message and note it ends on feels genuinely inspiring.

Everything besides the physics is man or man-made right down to the animals that are just dudes in costumes. The humor, editing and acting are straight out of old-school cartoons, and I\u2019ll give it that: it\u2019s an interesting and unique idea and it\u2019s engaging by virtue of that alone at first, but this curiosity quickly wears off.\n\nThe transition from cartoon to real life leaves behind the charm and exuberance of its animated counterpart and with it basically everything worthwhile. I appreciate the work that went into making it feel as cartoony as possible without resorting to a lampshading, low effort hack job that wants to be funny by being in on the joke of how shit the effects are.\n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a complete waste, but it\u2019s absolutely mind-boggling how poorly this is paced. I like the beginning and especially the last act, meaning it only has the small problem of overstaying its welcome for roughly 80 minutes. It\u2019s so insanely repetitive for most of its runtime that it feels like the whole idea wasn\u2019t thought out further than the basic premise. It\u2019s insane how something like this somehow turned out boring.\n\n\u00a0It has some videogame elements but that\u2019s also part of the problem, as you\u2019re watching someone grind for 80 minutes to get shop items. So even the parts that were ok at first just become annoying through this repetition. The last thing a movie like this should be is meandering. The story has so little substance and the humor only lands so seldomly that you can easily cut out some characters and storylines and be better off. I did not need to see him becoming a trapper. I would have accepted him having that ability from the start or obtaining it through a quick 2\u20133-minute sequence. There was no need to have a whole character for that.\n\nIn a way it\u2019s almost sad that the last act is so good because it highlights all the wasted potential. This is what the whole 35-minute short film should have been, dummies getting thrown against a wall and fast physical comedy that moves things forward.\n\n4.5/10\n\nDivines is about two friends in a Parisian ghetto who take up drug dealing to become rich.\n\nThere are things to like here, namely the leads and their relationship. They manage to be sympathetic even if you would hate these people in real life. It doesn\u2019t make them great characters, but they\u2019re also held back by how generic and uninspired the script is and they still manage to carry some parts. When it\u2019s just them hanging out removed from all the forced misery the movie is undoubtedly at its best.\n\nBut the plot is predictable in all the worst ways. It follows the typical from rags to riches to rags structure with its typical ups and downs with nothing new to bring to the table. The big downfall is plotted so poorly it needed to go through another draft or two because it\u2019s almost cartoonishly removed from reality, especially considering how gritty and serious the rest is.\n\nIt\u2019s also just straight up misery porn. Not the worst offender I\u2019ve ever seen, but misery instead of genuine emotions and conflicts are the go-to here. The ending especially ramps it up and sours what\u2019s otherwise still a watchable movie, but this manipulation seems to have worked on most people considering a lot of reviewers were moved by it instead of rolling their eyes.\n\n5/10", "score": 2, "level": 1, "children": []}]}, {"postID": "t3_1czgcli", "comment": "Well have to get ready for work.

The reason was that the general manager of the bank where he was employed was a fan of - I think - Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and my grandfather wanted something he could use to make small talk with his boss. At the time, it was quite remarkable that such a high-ranking person was a football fan, as football was still considered a working-class sport.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but English society seems more traditional to me and the English political caste even a lot more elitist than in Germany, for example. And I could imagine that someone like Mr. Sunak really has no idea about football, but thinks, okay, I'm in a pub, I should talk to people about football.", "score": 14, "level": 1, "children": [{"postID": "t3_1cyz1u4", "comment": "It has changed in the last 30 years. Sunak is a fan of his hometown club, Southampton, though I don't think he follows them that closely. The Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, is an Arsenal fan who apparently often goes to games -- and seems to play five-a-side regularly. There are more examples across the political spectrum, but given their occupation they aren't going to be fans who go to every home game.\n\nYou are right that the perception of football has changed, and I think this is in line with the reforms in the late 80s and early 90s that resulted in the reduction of violence and hooliganism at games. That and:\n\nthe relative success of the England men's team in 1990 and 1996\nthe 1988-89 top-flight title chase, which was won on the last day\nthe book Fever Pitch, by Nick Hornby\nthe class of '92, and David Beckham in particular\n\nchanged the image of football in the public consciousness, and made it so that one wasn't automatically tarred as a hooligan for supporting a team.\n\nAnd of course, the advent of the Premier League, which has now resulted in football becoming popular culture -- and I don't mean it is a part of pop culture, but that it is almost the dominant pop culture, in the way that music, movies etc. were. Like your grandfather, you almost have to know some events in football to be in public discourse, and not necessarily on-the-pitch events: see the Wagatha Christie case. I think maybe something similar in Germany is Trapattoni's famous press conference, which I understand has generated a few phrases which entered the German lexicon, e.g. \"flasche leere[?]\".\n\nAnd today of course there are dozens of podcasts, radio shows, TV programmes focused on or related to football. As the UK has moved into a post-industrial economy, its culture has become one of its biggest exports, so it would be politically negligent not to be aware of it. Would something like AppleTV's Ted Lasso have worked if he went to Italy or Spain? And of course, there is the business of selling off clubs to people and states who promise to invest in the local region -- or perhaps to make the right political donations.\n\nA generation ago, Tony Blair awkwardly headed a ball back and forth with Kevin Keegan.

It's hugely effective and Klopp at Dortmund & Early Liverpool really used this a lot.\n\nMidfield traps are about allowing the opposition into zones within midfield typically then collapsing on them quickly to regain possession, think of it like dangling a hook for the opposition, making it look like a pass is safe and open or at least available and then springing into action. Players who take too long on the ball or want/need a few touches before they play a pass are great targets for this\n\nThere are so many different ways and styles to press though, for example it's pretty common in games where two big teams play that they will apply less pressure overall but try to force their opponents to play from positions that they are either weaker in or just very low chances of success, think pressing team to force them to play long from their centrebacks in wide positions.
